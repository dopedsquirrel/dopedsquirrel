# About me

👋 Hey there, I'm Doped Squirrel! Embarking on a journey to study Computer Science at ETH Zurich, I'm currently navigating through the BMS (Berufsmaturitätsschule, a vocational baccalaureate program) and Passerelle, steps essential for securing my place at one of the world's leading universities. These preparatory courses are my launchpad into higher education, equipping me with the necessary foundation and opening the door to advanced academic pursuits.

As I progress, I'm reinforcing my learnings by engaging in Python projects, sharing my endeavors here on GitHub. Each project serves not only as a milestone towards mastering technical skills but also as a commitment to continuous learning and contributing to the open-source community.

🔍 Beyond the immediate goal, I'm on the lookout for opportunities to innovate and eventually create high-performance desktop applications. My ambition is to develop software that pushes the limits of technology and delivers exceptional user experiences.

📈 I document my journey on LinkedIn, hoping to inspire those on a similar path and share the experiences of juggling work, studies, and personal growth. Follow me as I explore the fascinating realm of computer science, aiming to make a significant impact through coding and collaboration.

Together, let's build the future!
